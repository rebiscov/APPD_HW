In this report, we are going to try several configurations and with
Simgrid, we will evaluate our programs and compare the sequential
algorithms with the parallel algorithms. The topology I used for this
is a clique. The platform file and the hostfile were generated using a
modification of the script that was given to us during TP 2 and was
originally meant to generate a ring topology. I precise that I will
not use ring topology because I think it is not necessary (there is no
interest to run a graph algorithm on a ring). Moreover, I find it too
bad that if one link is broken, the network can not work.

\section{Methodology}

We are going to separate the analysis of the Kruskal's algorithm and
Prim's algorithm. To do the analysis, we will test several
cases. First I note $G=(V, E)$ our graph and $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$. We
will test three cases for $m$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $m=2\times n$ (linear) the graph is in the file linear.txt
\item $m=\frac{n^{\frac{3}{2}}}{2}$ the graph is in the file threehalf.txt
\end{itemize}

And I will test those configurations for $n=500$ (my
laptop can not handle bigger graphs, the generation of  a graph never ends).
I will test this with $4$ cores and $10$ cores. I will take $500$ for
the maximum weight. Indeed, this value should not have a lot of
consequences on the speed of the algorithm (see appendix~A~\ref{sect:appendixa}). I will also test a latency
of $1\mu s$ and $100\mu s$. I will call the linear graph (with
$m=2\times n$) the linear graph and the graph with $m =
\frac{n^{\frac{3}{2}}}{2}$ the $\frac{3}{2}$ graph.

First, we can see that there is little different between the linear
graph and the 3/2 graph. That could be expected because in every
cases, because the graph is represented by a matrix, the complexity
will always depends on $n^2$ and not on $m$. This is why we do not
have a lot of differences between the linear graph and the $3/2$
graph, the number of edges has little effect on the number of steps
that the algorithm will do.

Moreover, we see that when running the parallel algorithms on 8 cores,
it is a bit slower that on 4 cores. I think this comes from the fact
that my processor has only 4 cores and when running the algorithms on
8 cores, I do not gain any computation time but I loose time in communications
between the ``virtual'' processors. Now we will compare the sequential
algorithms. I will just study the linear graph because we saw that the
results were similar with the 3/2 graph. I will only study the case
with 4 cores because this is when my computer is the more efficient.

\section{Comparison between sequential and parallel algorithms}

\subsection{Sequential Prim VS Parallel Prim}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=10cm]{com_prim.png}
  \caption{Comparison of sequential Prim's algorithm and parallel
    Prim's algorithm}
  \label{fig:comp_prim}
\end{figure}

As we can see on figure~\ref{fig:comp_prim} the sequential algorithm
is a little worst than the parallel one with a latency of $1\mu s$ but
a lot better than the parallel one with a latency of $100 \mu$ (please
note that the scale is logarithmic). One can conclude that the latency
has a lot of influence on the efficiency of the parallel Prim's
algorithm. This is probably due to the fact that when all the
processors have their candidates, they have to send it the processor 0
that has to handle a lot of communications at one time, and during
this time the other processor are not working.

\subsection{Sequential Kruskal VS Parallel Kruskal}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=10cm]{com_kruskal.png}
  \caption{Comparison of sequential Kruskal's algorithm and parallel
    Kruskal's algorithm}
  \label{fig:comp_kruskal}
\end{figure}

As we can see on figure~\ref{fig:comp_kruskal}, for a latency of $1\mu
s$, the parallel algorithm is a lot better than the sequential
one. For a latency of $100 \mu s$, the parallel algorithm is a little
better than the sequential one. First conclusion, the efficiency of
the parallel algorithm is a lot better. I think we can explain this
because in the parallel Kruskal, a processor wait little for another
one. Indeed a processor do some computations send or receive
information and then continue working but it does not need to wait
for an answer of the processor it communicated with. Also, the
algorithm is a lot less ``centralized''. There is no processor that
have to regularly get information from everyone, a processor only
work with one close neighbour. I think this is why the parallel
algorithm in Kuskal is a lot better.

\section{Conclusion}

To conclude, we have seen that the communications have a strong impact
on the efficiency of the distributed algorithms. Kruskal seems to be
the the faster probably because of the face that we do not have to
send something to one processor regularly. But to be really efficient,
the communications need to have a low latency.

\section*{Appendix A}
\label{sect:appendixa}
I want to check that the maximal weight as little incidence on the
computation time. I take a graph with $n=500$ and $m=1000$, with the
maximal weight $W=500$ and an other identical graph but with $W=2$ and
I compared the computation time. I used Simgrid with 4 processors for
the parallel algorithms, and bandwith of 100Gpbs and a latency of
1$\mu$s.

One can see one table~\ref{tab:collisions} that this has no influence
on the final speed. This is normal because the equality between two
edges does not make more computations.

The graph I used for this is called ``collisions.txt''.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
    \hline
    & $W=500$& $W=2$\\
    \hline    
    Prim parallel & $3\times 10^{-3}$ & $3\times 10^{-3}$\\
    \hline    
    Kruskal parallel & $9\times 10^{-6}$ & $9.1\times 10^{-6}$\\
    \hline    
    Prim sequential  & $5\times 10^{-3}$ & $5\times 10^{-3}$\\
    \hline    
    Kruskal sequential & $2\times 10^{-3}$ & $2\times 10^{-3}$\\
    \hline                           
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Comparison of the computation time (in second) of the
    different algorithms on the same graph but one with the maximal
    weight being 500 and the other one being 2}
